# 04-Homework-WebAPIs

For this assignment I have created a set of questions to answer in a timed quiz form. once start quiz is clicked a timer will start and present the first question. After you click the answer for the question it will prompt the next question and so on until you are done. If the wrong answer is clicked the time will reduce by 10 seconds (I do not have this functionality). your correct scores should be logged and totaled at the end so that you can view your high score after you type your initials and submit them. (I do not have this included yet either).
